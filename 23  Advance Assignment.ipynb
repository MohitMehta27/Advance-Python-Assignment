    "When comparing different figures on the same graph, there are several choices to enhance the comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjust the scaling: You can adjust the scaling of the graph to ensure that the data points or figures are clearly visible. This can be done by modifying the axes limits or using logarithmic scaling if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use different colors or markers: Assign different colors, markers, or line styles to each figure to make them visually distinct. This can help differentiate between the figures and make the comparison easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add labels or legends: Label each figure or data series with a descriptive label or legend. This provides a clear identification of each figure and helps the viewer understand which data corresponds to which figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide additional visual cues: You can include additional visual cues such as error bars, confidence intervals, or shaded regions to highlight variations or uncertainties in the data. These cues can enhance the comparison between figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilize subplots or insets: If the figures have significantly different scales or ranges, you can consider using subplots or insets to display them side by side or with zoomed-in views. This allows for a more detailed comparison while maintaining clarity."

Regular multiplication performs element-wise multiplication between two arrays, resulting in a new array with the same shape as the input arrays."
