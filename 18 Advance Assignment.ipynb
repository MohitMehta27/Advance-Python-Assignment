They can be created and edited with text editors and contain information that can be interpreted and modified without specialized software. Binary files, on the other hand, store data in a format that is not directly readable by humans, using binary digits. They require specific software or programs to understand and manipulate their content, as binary files can store various types of data beyond plain text, such as images, audio, or executable code."

    "Portability: Binary representations of integers can vary across different systems and architectures.

This can lead to data corruption or incorrect interpretation of the integer value.\n",

    "Readability and debugging: Binary data is not human-readable, making it difficult to inspect and debug. If you encounter issues with the stored integer value or need to verify the data integrity, working with binary files can be more cumbersome than text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Binary representations often have fixed sizes. If you want to store an integer that exceeds the capacity of the chosen binary format, you'll need to handle overflow or find alternative strategies to represent the value accurately."
