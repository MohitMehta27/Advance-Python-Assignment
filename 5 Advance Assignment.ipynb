    "Composition is a way of building complex objects or classes by combining smaller, simpler objects. It allows to create new classes that are made up of one or more instances of existing classes, known as \"components\".The idea behind composition is to build a larger, more complex object by combining smaller, simpler objects that have specific, well-defined functionalities. These smaller objects can be reused in other contexts, and by composing them together, you can create more complex objects that have more functionality than any of the individual components alone."
