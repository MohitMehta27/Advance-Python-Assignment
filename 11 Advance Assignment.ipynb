    " a metaclass is a class that defines the behavior and structure of other classes. It is often referred to as the \"class of classes\" or \"class factory.\" Metaclasses allows to control various aspects of class creation and define class-level behavior. You can think of them as a way to modify or extend the normal rules and behavior of classes. Some common use cases for metaclasses include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying class creation behavior: You can override methods such as __new__ or __init__ in a metaclass to customize how classes are instantiated and initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding class-level attributes and methods: Metaclasses can automatically add attributes and methods to classes when they are created. This can be useful for implementing class-level functionality or enforcing certain conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enforcing coding standards: Metaclasses can enforce coding standards by checking class attributes or methods during creation and raising errors or warnings if they don't meet the specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing automatic registrations: Metaclasses can automatically register classes in a registry or perform other setup tasks when a class is defined."
