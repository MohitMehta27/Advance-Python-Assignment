    "Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module in Python. This can be beneficial in situations where different parts of the codebase require different functionalities or components from the same module, allowing for more modular and organized code. However, excessive or unnecessary multiple imports should be avoided to prevent code complexity and potential conflicts. It is generally recommended to import modules at the top of the file and use specific imports based on the required functionalities."

    "One characteristic of a module in Python is that it is a separate file that contains Python code. Modules provide a way to organize code into reusable units, allowing for better code organization and modular development. Modules can define functions, classes, and variables that can be imported and used in other Python scripts or modules. By encapsulating related code within modules, it promotes code reusability, maintainability, and separation of concerns"
