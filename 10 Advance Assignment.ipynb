    "__getattr__ is called when an attribute is accessed and not found through the normal lookup process. It acts as a fallback mechanism, allowing customization for non-existing or dynamically computed attributes. It is only invoked when the attribute is not found in the object's dictionary or its class hierarchy.\n",

    "On the other hand, __getattribute__ is called for every attribute access, regardless of whether the attribute exists or not. It is a powerful method that intercepts all attribute accesses and allows for attribute manipulation or logging. However, care must be taken within __getattribute__ to avoid infinite recursion when accessing attributes through self.attribute_name."
