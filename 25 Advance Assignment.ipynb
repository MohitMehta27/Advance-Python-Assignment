    "Case Sensitivity: Ticker symbols are often case-sensitive, so if the user enters the symbol in the wrong case, it may not match the expected format.

    "A legend is crucial on a stock market chart as it provides a visual guide to interpret the various elements such as lines, bars, or symbols. It identifies the meaning of different colors or patterns used for different data series, making it easier to understand the information presented. Without a legend, the chart can be confusing and difficult to interpret, especially when multiple data series are plotted. The legend helps users quickly associate specific elements with their corresponding data, improving the clarity and comprehension of the chart."

    "A 180-day moving average is a technical indicator that calculates the average of the closing prices of a security or financial instrument over the past 180 trading days. It is used to smooth out short-term fluctuations in price data and identify long-term trends. By taking the average of a longer time period, the 180-day moving average provides a more stable line that helps traders and analysts understand the overall direction of the market. It is commonly used as a reference point for identifying potential support and resistance levels and making trading decisions based on the prevailing trend."

    "1. The sys.modules dictionary contains a cache of all modules that have been previously imported.\n",
