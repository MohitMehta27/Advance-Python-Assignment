It represents the expected value or average value around which the data tends to cluster. A higher mean shifts the distribution to the right, while a lower mean shifts it to the left.\n",

A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely grouped together, resulting in a narrower and taller distribution. Conversely, a larger standard deviation leads to a wider and flatter distribution."

Logarithms help solve equations involving exponentiation and provide a way to find the unknown exponent or power in an equation.
