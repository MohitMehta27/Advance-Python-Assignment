    "In regular-expression search patterns and replacement strings, using the raw-string indicator (r) is not always necessary but is often recommended to avoid unintended interpretation or escaping of special characters. The use of raw strings (r\"pattern\") is particularly useful in regular-expression search patterns to prevent unwanted escaping of backslashes and special characters. Regular expressions often include backslashes to escape metacharacters or to specify special sequences. By using raw strings, backslashes are treated as literal backslashes, ensuring that the pattern is interpreted correctly"
